## Info

We created a website that makes it easier for citizens to manage their government tasks, like taxes and rights. The platform is designed to be simple and easy to use, with a modern and colorful look. We built it using Java JSF, SQL, and SCSS.

The website has three main sections: a login page for secure access, a home page that acts as a hub for all the features, and a page that showcases the different functions available. The home page is clean and well-organized, making it easy for users to find what they need. We used Figma to design a visually appealing interface with a vibrant color scheme that keeps users engaged.

In short, our website is a one-stop solution for citizens to manage their government-related tasks with ease. We put a lot of emphasis on making it simple, accessible, and good-looking.
